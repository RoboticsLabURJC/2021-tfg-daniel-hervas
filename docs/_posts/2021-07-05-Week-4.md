Hello all!

On this week I've worked on having two working brains, one for each car (Host and Guest). Now we are able to run code on both of the cars.

Also, I've added the bird-eye for the Guest car, so now we can see both of the cars on the canvas birds eye map. Here is a visual example:

Here is a video demonstration for the WebRTC-prototype exercise:
