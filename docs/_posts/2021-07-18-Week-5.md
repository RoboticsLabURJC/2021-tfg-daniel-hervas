Hello all!

This week I have worked on pulling my content to the test.unibotics.org machine on the urjc labs, also I have implemented a new exercise prototype, in this one the user is 
able to select a circuit to run the code in. Finally, for this circuits I have implemented a system that, from the manager-3.1.py when the exercise is launched, an argument is passed
to the host GUI wich is an string with the circuit name, in order that map.py knows wich scale will be applied to the coordinate conversion. Here is a demo of the multiple circuit selector:
