Hello all!

This week I have been researching about Django Channels, WebSockets and WebRTC.
With all of this, I have implemented some projects:
- Text Chat with Django Channels
- VideoChat with Django Channels (text and signaling server) + WebRTC
- VideoChat with Django Channels + WebRTC streaming noVNC canvas
