# Week 11. Vacuum Cleaner evaluator optimised and Sync Follow Lime Game Demo.

Hello all!

Thks week I have worked on optimisin the Vacuum Cleaner game evaluator. What I have done is to use a matrix array for the checkpoints instead of 
using just a ine dimension array for searching the closer cell to the vacuum.

Also, I have recorded a video demo for the synchronous follow line game. Here it is:
