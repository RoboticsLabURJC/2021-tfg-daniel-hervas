Hello all!

On this week I have been using the web version of the Follow Line exercise, it has been fun, I have addapted to the new platform the code that I implemented last year 
on Robotics course. Here is a visual example of my version:

In addition, I've also researched about Django framework for python, I have been following
the 3 first tutorials from the official documentation. I've learnt the following:
- Request and Responses
- Models and the admin site
- Views and templates

So summing up, what I've done during this week is the following:
- I have been been using JdeRobot framework as an user, and it works really good.
- Addapted my Follow Line code to this version, and tested the dockericed exercise, it works great!
- Researched about Django framework
