Hello all!

The main task I've been doing this week is to add a new game for Unibotics called Drone Cat Mouse Game. Also, I've worked on the asynchronous follow line game adding the 
missing difficulty (Medium) to the difficulty selector. I've created the users bot1, bot2 and bot3 wich will contain the code for each difficulty of a game.
Looking at follow line game synchronous I've researched about WebRTC and concluded on that we need a TURN server in order to bypass the NAT connection issues.
