# Week 10. Synchronous Follow Line Game Update.

Hello all!

On this week I've worked on many things, first of all, I've recorder a video for the Follow Line Game Asynchronous exercise, and with this, 
I've found some bugs and fixed them. Here is the Follow Line Game Aynchronous Demo:

[![Follow Line Game Aynchronous Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cdpJvTWEBHU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpJvTWEBHU)

After fixing every existent bug, I started working on the Synchronous Follow Line Game, and I made many changes to it, these are the follwing:

* Birds Eye vía DataChannels to the guest 
* Implemented data channels in order to sync both browsers
* One template based exercise, now the exercise will use only one html and not a different one for each peer (Host and Guest)
* The connection and code status now is stored in the front end
* Deleted guest.html template
* Now WebRTC files are in **`unibotics-exercises/static/assets/exercises/follow_line_game_sync/js/webrtc`** directory and not in the webserver
* The code status is renamed for both users, now is displayed as "Host Code" and "Guest Code". Also, it has been moved on the template to the control navbar
* No button needed to see the chat, now the user will be able to see the chat under the text editor. A button will be implemented in order to hide the code editor
* Navbar buttons that are not usefull on this game mode are deleted
* Fix distance evaluator bug
* On birds-eye canvas, now the guest player username is displayed on the top of the car beacon
* noVNC stream now is cropped by the host before being streamed   

Also, here are some screenshots for the host and the guest interfaces.
