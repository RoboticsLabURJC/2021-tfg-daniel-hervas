    "The intention of this practice is to implement the logic that allows a vacuum robot clean a selected area avoiding the obstacles incluiding in it. Futhermore, the robot has implemented the auto-location skill so it will know the area previusly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practice a world has been designed for the Gazebo simulator (see section 2.1). The main task will consist of implementing a crash detector and a auto-location algorithm.\n",

The intention is to make the robot clean the large area as posible with an auto-location algorithm (wich means the robot must clean with an intelligence, not just crash and turn).\n",

This component connects to Gazebo to teleoperate the vacuum robot (or send orders to it) and receives values from its laser and the location of a map. The student has to modify this component and add code to accomplish the exercise. In particular, it is required to modify the execute() method.\n"
