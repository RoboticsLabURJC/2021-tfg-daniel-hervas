# Django Channels Tutorial
For this project I will be following the tutorial offered by the [official documentation site](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/).

## Tutorial part 1: Basic Setup
Here I have just created the paths for the urls, the views and also the index.html template, just the basics of a Django project.

After all the basic setup, I started creating the chat lobby template, in order that when the user types a lobby name and gets redirected to the lobby url it doesnt get an error message, and a template is rendered.
